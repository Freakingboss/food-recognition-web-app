# Food Recognition Web Aplication (FRW)
## Welcome to a university final project

This project is a web application that runs in the browser. It is able to recognise food pictures taken by the user and register the calories to your profile.

FRW consists of 3 repositories
- [FRW](https://github.com/brantac/food-recognition-web-app)
- [FMS (Food Model Server)](https://github.com/brantac)
- [Database](https://github.com/brantac)

FRW is an Express.js server, which not only serves the web pages, but connects and 'talk' to the database whenever the user sends some data or delete something from his profile.
